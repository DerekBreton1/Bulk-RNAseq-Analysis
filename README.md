## Methods
RNA sequencing data were obtained from 3 healthy and 6 COVID-19 infected human derived samples. Among the 6 infected patients, 3 were characterized as having a severe infection, but not requiring hospitalization in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 3 were characterized as having a severe infection that required hospitalization in an ICU.
